# geoip
This node.js App let to you run a command on linux or windows and return result over HTTP protocol on json format

Just require node-cmd installed on node.js modules and voila!!

PD:
For now this app run over HTTP using URL format http://<ip_server>/ip/111.111.111.111 because orignally was created for read GeoIp data from a linux server with the command geoiplookup installed. But is possible use another command like echo or whatever, just you need realize some modifications to code.
